Room philosophies:
	-All rooms should have 1-3 resources, except some dead ends which could have up to 4
	-Resources should be more plentiful in rooms with fewer doors, but that won’t always be the case.
	-Resources will almost always be generated in the spots they are given
	-Power ups should only be spawned in rooms with a lot of effort required to get the power up
	-Power ups should usually be in dead end rooms
	-Keep the average travel time through rooms somewhat constant (no tricky winding paths unless they’re optional for progress)

	-Rooms in which the home can spawn will end in _0
	-Rooms in which Power ups can spawn will end in _power
	
	We’ll generate one power up room per floor and then stop picking power up rooms from there
